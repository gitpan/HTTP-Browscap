Here is v0.01 of HTTP:Browscap.

It provides information
on a web browsers' capabilities (eg - table support, frame
support), the browser being identified by its "User Agent" string.
This will use the existing Microsoft Browscap.ini database, a 
version of which is freely downloadable and actively maintained at 
http://www.browserhawk.com/browscap/

As the version number suggests this is a very early version and
consequently has no Makefile.PL etc. I will be polishing up this module
in the next few months and the interface may be subject to change.

Please check the module's homepage at

or contact me at perl@jamespo.ukshells.co.uk


Thanks,


James Powell
