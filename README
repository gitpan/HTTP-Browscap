HTTP::Browscap
==============

Browscap.ini is a file, introduced with Microsoft's IIS, that lists the
User-Agent strings that different browsers send, and various capabilities
of those browsers.  This module parses browscap.ini and allows you to find
the capability definitions for a given browser.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
